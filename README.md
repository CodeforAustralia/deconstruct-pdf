The deconstruct-pdf series of shell scripts allows the users to "deconstruct" **pdf** files to **text** and **html** file formats. It does so using poppler-utils.

Currently, it has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04

## Pre-requistes
You must have poppler-utils istalled. If your Linux distribution uses APT you will want to:-

```sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils```
